# Napoleon
Subtitles for Parts 1 and 2 of the 2024 cut of Abel Gance's Napoléon, which is a restoration of his Grande Version.

The subtitles are presented for each part as formatted and unformatted .srt files for optimal flexibility.

The formatted .srt version has the subtitles in yellow text with a sans-serif typeface on a translucent black background for optimal legibility in all scenarios.
Viewers can override this with their preferred settings using the unformatted .srt.

Those distributing the film, by whatever means, are encouraged to embed, encode, hard code, or otherwise append these subtitles to the same wherever appropriate.

## Notes on the Translation and the Subtitling
The intertitles, titles, and lyrics in French have been translated keeping the tone, rhythm, historicity, and exactitude of the translation at the forefront of the endeavor.
It is almost always jarring when subtitles clash with what they're supplementing tonally and/or rhythmically, especially — but hardly solely — when the viewer isn't accustomed to subtitles.

Line breaks for the translations of titles and intertitles are provided at the same place where they are present in the source, in most cases. In some cases, minor but insurmountable differences between standard Englishes and Frenches made it difficult to ensure such breaking while also maintaining legibility in a way that flows the way the title or intertitle does in the source.

So, in a way, the order of priority, as far as it can be schematized, is: Rhythm > Tone > Historicity > Exactitude; however, they bleed into one another quite a bit.

Rhythm: flow, meter, brevity.

Tone: formality, structure, rhythm.

Historicity: facticity, names and spellings, tone.

Exactitude: precision, accuracy, historicity.

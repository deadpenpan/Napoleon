La Cinémathèque française presents

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,919
Napoléon as Seen by Abel Gance (1927)

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,759
Reconstructed and restored under the guidance of Georges Mourier, assisted by Laure Marchaut,

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,359
with the help of the Eclair Classics/L'Image Retrouvée laboratories, set to music by Simon Cloquet-Lafollye.

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,600
The restoration work was carried out by La Cinémathèque française

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,160
with the aid of the Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée and 

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,440
the Centre national de la musique in partnership with Radio France.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,159
To film his Napoléon, Abel Gance shot with several cameras, generating two different negatives and hence two original versions:

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,320
one called "Opéra" (Premiered at the Opéra de Paris, 4 April 1927, 4 hours long)

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,520
the second called "Apollo" (presented to the press and the operators of the Apollo theater in May 1927, 9 hours and 30 minutes long).

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,520
Gance then established a final version from the Apollo negative alone, of a length of around 7 hours.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,439
It is on this definitive version called the "Grande Version" that the restoration carried out by La Cinémathèque française between 2015 and 2022 is based.

14
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:59,520
The splitting of the film into two parts was carried out from the Abel Gance archives preserved at La Cinémathèque française and la Bibliothèque nationale de France.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,319
It includes the final triptych called "Departure of the Army from Italy" according to the three-screen projection process conceived by Gance that he would later name "Polyvision".

16
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,120
The reconstruction and restoration of images were carried out from elements preserved in the following archives:


17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,280
La Cinémathèque française, Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée, la Cinémathèque de Toulouse, la Cinémathèque royale de Belgique (Bruxelles),

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,400
la Cinémathèque de Corse-Casa di Lume, la Cinémathèque du Luxembourg, The Danish Film Institute (Copenhagen), Filmoteca de Catalunya (Barcelona),

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,040
Fondazione Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia-Cineteca Nazionale (Roma), Jugoslovenska Kinoteka (Beograd), MoMA (New York), and several private collections.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,799
The elements were digitized in total immersion in 5K at the Eclair Classics/L'Image Retrouvée laboratories with the help of Nitroscan.

21
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,239
The digital elements were conformed, restored, tinted, and calibrated.

22
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,400
Abel Gance did not give instructions for the musical accompaniment of the definitive version called the "Grande Version", la Cinémathèque francaise entrusted

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,400
composer Simon Cloquet-Lafollye with the order of an original score constituted by arrangements of pieces drawing from a symphonic repertoire going from Mozart to Penderecki.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,159
This score was executed and recorded by Radio France's musical formations (Orchestre National de France,

25
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,359
Orchestre Philharmonique et Choeur de Radio France) under the guidance of Fabien Gabel with the participation of the tenor Benjamin Bernheim.

00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:48,840
as Seen by Abel Gance

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:57,520
A cinegraphic epic in two parts

32
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:07,240
The triple-screen process at the end of the second part is one of Abel Gance's inventions.

33
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:17,439
Its use for shooting was patented by André Debrie, and for projection by the House of Gaumont.

with
Albert Dieudonné
in the role of
Napoléon Bonaparte

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,479
“I would like to be my
“posterity and witness
“what a poet would make

40
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,719

Prologue
BRIENNE

43
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:57,920
Then came the memorable winter of 1781
where the snow piles up in the
courtyard of the Ecole de Brienne.
(Hist.)

44
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:18,600
Napoléon Bonaparte
at the age of 11 years...
Mr. Vladimir Roudenko

45
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,199
... had sworn to resist with
ten comrades in a fort
he built himself...

46
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,079
... the assaults
of forty artillerymen.
(Hist.)

47
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,160
The Minim Friars who
encourage these combats

48
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,839
and applaud the students
distinguished by their address

49
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:55,680
or the invention of some
stratagem, emboldened this day

50
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,079
by an all too vivid curiosity...
(Hist.)

51
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:46,519
The two leaders of the opposite camp
Phélipeaux and Peccaduc, personal

52
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:52,040
enemies of Napoléon in Brienne
and that by a troubling chance

53
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,360
we find standing
againt him for 15 years on

54
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,319
most of the battlefields
of the Empire.
(Hist.)

55
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,319
Thinking of surprising Napoléon

56
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,200
Tristan Fleuri,
refectory boy.

Mr Koline

57
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,759
“Watch out Napoléon!...”

58
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,679
“Phélipeaux puts stones
in his snowballs!”

59
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,519
“Thank you!”

60
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,720
Already possessing an unprecedented
mastery, he dictated the

61
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,960
movements, immobile in the
center of the brawls.
(Historical)

62
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
“Let the victor of the combat
come here.”

63
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,720
“Your name?”
(Hist.)

64
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,559
“Napoléon.”
(with a Corsican accent,
he pronounced it Nabulioné)
(Hist.)

65
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,759
“How do you say it?
Straw nose?....”
(Hist.)

66
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:38,480
“Little one, you will go far,
remember that it is Pichegru
who told you so.”
(Hist.)

67
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,480
The geography lesson:
study on the climate of islands.

68
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,200
“As for Corsica, this
almost savage island...”

69
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,839
As for Corsica, the most beautiful
island in the world, the climate
there is...

70
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,839
“Oh... I forgot!”

71
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,599
“A small islet lost in
the Ocean...”

72
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,400
“Saint Helena, a small island...”

73
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,039
St helena small island

74
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,880
I am very unhappy
here, and my heart

75
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,920
is not made for
these people who surround me.
“Historical”

76
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,359
I wait since I want
to one day free
my country.

77
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:08,400
What do we know? The fate
of an Empire often depends
on one man.

78
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,359
-Napoléon
“Historical”

79
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,799
“Sir, Napoléon hides
letters in his bed!”

80
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,319
Bonaparte's only
comforter in the attic
of Tristan Fleuri.

81
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:53,039
A proud companion in misfortune,
a gift from uncle Paraviccini,
a great hunter of eagles
in Ajaccio.

82
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,119
“Who is it that made my
eagle flee?”

83
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,640
“So, you are all
culpable!”

84
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,799
“What do you think you are, little
rascal?”

85
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,760
“I maintain that he will go far.
He is granite heated in
a volcano.”

86
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,400
End of the

DEATH TO THE TYRANTS

90
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,480
Danton's secretary,
Camille Desmoulins...
(Mr. Vidalin)

91
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,440
and his wife Lucile.
(Ms. Francine Mussey)

92
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:59,159
The three gods...

93
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:09,679
DANTON...
(Mr. Koubitzky)

94
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,880
... MARAT...
(Mr. Antonin Artaud)

95
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,119
... ROBESPIERRE.
(Mr. Edmond van Daële)

96
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,000
“Babblers!”

97
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:43,920
“Your friend Diétrich sends you
an officer of the Rhine Army
bearing a song
that he believes useful to the people.

98
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,719
Can we distribute
the copies
by attending the session?”

99
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,360
The tense crowd felt
vaguely that a great

100
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,920
flame was going to rise
within the history of
the world.

00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:34,599
Napoléon lived in Paris
in misery.

167
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:06,440
The strollers, including Josephine
de Beauharnais, sought

168
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:13,239
this morning the famous
seer, Mademoiselle
Lenormant.

169
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:52,360
“An incredible fortune... you
will be QUEEN, madame!”

170
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:13,400
Bonaparte's misery
was nothing in relation
to that of the suburbs...

171
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:58,400
The hearts sing, but
the stomachs scream of hunger
and the night of 10 August bursts

172
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:04,360
abruptly, bringing
to Bonaparte echos
of a crumbling throne...

173
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,920
What remains
of a great event, seen
in a small room.

174
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:14,679
Anything that involves
carnage is worthless,
if one is not careful,

175
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:20,039
the best fruits of
the Revolution will be
lost.
(Hist.)

176
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:34,039
At the National Assembly,
the agony of the ROYALTY.

177
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:44,199
(The King Louis XVI:
Mr. Louis Sance)
(The Queen Marie Antoinette:
Ms. Suzanne Blanchetti)

178
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,480
“If the Revolution
is a furnace,
it is also a forge!

179
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,119
Let us construct the REPUBLIC
now!”

180
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,360
“What must be done to vanquish
the enemies of the Fatherland?”
(Hist.)

181
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,920
“Audacity,
still more audacity!”
(Hist.)

182
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:48,400
How cowardly and vile men are.
The peoples are hardly worth
the trouble of concern.

183
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:56,400
Each one seeks his own interest
and wants to achieve it
through horror.

“This is what you did
today with the ROYALTY.”
(Hist.)

189
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:19,680
And second by second,
while the Royalty
crumbled,

190
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:25,840
Napoléon vaguely
felt a source of light
growing in him.

191
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:43,720
IN CORSICA

192
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:51,800
Bonaparte, who
has not returned to
Corsica for 12 years,
arrives at Ajaccio with

193
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:58,800
his sister Elisa to
try and awaken the
national sentiment there.
(Hist.)

194
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,239
Elisa Bonaparte
(Mrs. Yvette Dieudonné)

195
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:35,479
“Mama Lœtitia.”
(Hist.)

196
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:35,800
The best friend
of the Bonaparte family,
the shepherd Santo Ricci
(Mr. Henri Baudin)

197
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,880
“Hello "Cousing".”

198
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:33,199
“This is not
the time to laugh,
Napoléon!....”

199
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:50,199
“You must, this instant,
learn
the awful truth.”

200
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:16,720
“Paoli, our old
and great Paoli,
a venerated father to us all,

201
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:21,199
is about to sell us to
the English.”
(Hist.)

202
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:39,720
“As long as I live,
Corsica will never
become English.”
(Hist.)

203
01:20:29,239 --> 01:20:36,439
All the scenes in Corsica,
notably, were shot
in the exact houses

204
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:44,039
and sites where rigorously
controlled facts
took place.
(Author's Note.)

205
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,520
HIS COUNTRY

206
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,600
At Casone cave,
which had seen his adolescent
reveries,

207
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:01,800
Napoléon came to meditate
on the fate
of his tiny fatherland.

208
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,880
His House.

209
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:44,640
NAPOLEON
WAS BORN IN THIS HOUSE
15 AUGUST 1769

210
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:27,199
His Family.

211
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:55,479
His dear mama Lœtitia,
his brothers Joseph, Lucien,
Louis, Jérôme, his sisters

212
01:24:55,479 --> 01:25:02,159
Elisa, Pauline, Caroline,
in the adorable garden
of Milelli.
(Historical)

213
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,439
Lœtitia Bonaparte...
(Mrs. Eugénie Buffet)

214
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:56,720
... the Bonaparte family
finds in front of it the jealous
ferocity of Pozzo di Borgo

215
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:04,520
become attorney general
in Corsica
and secretary of Paoli.
(Hist)

216
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:43,880
Will he choose, outside
every political agitation,
a sweet and familial life...

217
01:26:59,239 --> 01:27:06,479
... or indeed, sacrificing
his personal happiness,
will he try to become

218
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,880
an important player
on the world stage?...

219
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:31,640
Napoléon, an official representative
of France,
soon saw move away from him

220
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:38,239
every inhabitant
who wished, with Paoli,
that English domination and

221
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:43,079
the hate of Pozzo find there
a fertile ground.
(Hist.)

222
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,039
“Death to Napoléon Buonaparte!”
(Hist.)

223
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:37,439
It is at this time that,
neglecting the wise counsel
of his family who advised

224
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:45,279
fleeing the hate of an entire
people, that Napoléon came each
day to the the deserted point

225
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:51,399
of the Sanguinaires
speaking of the future
with his friend the Ocean.

226
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:32,199
The entire question was
whether Corsica
would become English,
according to Paoli's desire,

227
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:39,279
or whether it would remain
French according to that
of Bonaparte.
(Arthur Lévy)

228
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,640
Paoli
(Mr. Schutz)

229
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:11,279
“Napoléon Buonaparte, by
his secret correspondence
with the Convention, is
currently the most serious

230
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:18,680
obstacle to our alliance
with England.
In the name of the Corsican Fatherland
give me his life.” 

231
01:34:01,159 --> 01:34:10,640
Order to civil and military
authorities to
pursue Napoléon
Buonaparte, traitor to his fatherland.

232
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:19,800
A bonus of 500 pounds to whoever
brings him back dead or alive.
For the Corsican Consultation.
Paoli

233
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:59,640
At the Rey
Mill (Roy Mill) inn
where politics holds its
seats.

234
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:51,560
ORDER
To civil & military Authorities
to pursue Napoléon
Buonaparte, traitor to the fatherland.

235
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,920
A bonus of FIVE HUNDRED pounds
to the one who brings him back dead or alive.

236
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,720
In the name of the Corsican Consultation
The Supreme Chief
PAOLI

237
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:21,279
Napoléon's brothers,
Lucien and Joseph, leave
disguised for Calvi

238
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:26,000
to ask for help
from the French authorities.

239
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:56,560
“What will you do
my dear son?”

240
01:38:00,119 --> 01:38:02,640
“Act, Mama!”

241
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:24,680
From this instant until
his return to France,
the life of the young lieutenant

242
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:31,840
of artillery will become the
most incredible of adventure
novels.

243
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:48,680
“Our fatherland is Spain
with Buttafuaco!
Death to Napoléon Bonaparte!”
(Hist.)

244
01:38:55,279 --> 01:38:59,920
“No, our fatherland
is Italy with
the Duke of Savoy!

245
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,720
Death to Napoléon Bonaparte!”
(Hist.)

246
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:17,000
“No, our fatherland
is England with Paoli!
Death to Napoléon Bonaparte!”
(Hist.)

247
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:42,199
“No... our fatherland
is France!”
(Hist.)

248
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,359
“With me!”
(Hist.)

249
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:57,960
“If you could
comprehend what dream
enthuses my soul,

250
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,800
you would all follow me.”
(Hist.)

251
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:35,199
“France, you see,
is the mother of us all!...”
(Historical.)

252
01:42:47,319 --> 01:42:53,399
“Believe me...
There will come a man who
will know how to gather in his head

253
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:57,479
all the hopes
of the nation, and then....”
(Hist.)

254
01:46:46,279 --> 01:46:50,439
“The war with France
is declared.”
(Historical)

255
01:47:56,399 --> 01:47:58,840
“I am taking it away.
It is too big
for you!...”

256
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:57,760
In an instant,
the announcement of the declaration
of war, linked to the flight

257
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,960
of Bonaparte, added to
the overexcitement
of minds.

258
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,199
Surrounded by the tower
of Capitello.

259
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:58,760
The sea... supreme
resource of outlaws.

260
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:20,359
“Neither sails, nor oars!”

261
01:55:04,279 --> 01:55:06,079
“I will
give it back to you!”

262
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:03,680
It is thus that on 26 May
1795 at the tower of Capitello,
after an epic pursuit,

263
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:10,640
Napoléon set sail out to
sea in the boss Ucciani's
gondola.
(d'Alboise)


264
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:48,840
The outlaws.

265
02:00:37,159 --> 02:00:40,680
The maquis always saves
the outlaws.

266
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:51,680
The dangerous sirocco
rose gradually.

267
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:12,479
Napoléon, dreading the 
storm, sought to
follow the coast.

268
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:41,399
Vertiginously
carried out to sea,
Napoléon was about to

269
02:03:41,399 --> 02:03:46,000
begin an epic battle
against destiny.

270
02:04:13,319 --> 02:04:22,479
That same night, at the
same hour, another
formidable storm
was raging at the Convention.

271
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:43,119
“My conclusion?
It is a decree

272
02:04:43,119 --> 02:04:47,239
of indictment
against all the Girondins!”
(Hist.)

273
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:13,439
The assembly
felt like it was under
lightning.
(Thibaudeau)

274
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:12,680
While all the giants
of the Revolution were to be

275
02:13:12,680 --> 02:13:24,279
brought one after the other
into the frightful whirlwinds
of the Terror...

276
02:13:24,279 --> 02:13:35,359
... a wild, laughing man,
tamer of oceans, opening
his tricolor sail
to the mad wind of the Revolution,

277
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:46,600
would be borne magnificently
by the revolutionary aquilon
to the highest pediment of
History.

278
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:52,199
Historical providence:
on a sailboat carrying
two of the brothers of
Bonaparte...

279
02:15:52,199 --> 02:15:55,000
CHANCE

280
02:18:22,399 --> 02:18:27,920
“My family... quick, quick...
to his rescue... to Aspretto.”
(Historical.)

281
02:18:58,479 --> 02:19:00,760
Some hours
later.

282
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:47,360
“Alas! my children.
Our poor house
ransacked on the orders

283
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:52,719
of Paoli! We ourselves
forced to flee
our dear fatherland.”

284
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:09,319
“Chance” carried
towards France

285
02:20:09,319 --> 02:20:15,319
a future emperor,
3 kings, and a queen.
(Historical)

286
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:27,360
“... And now,
we have no more
than one fatherland, only one...

287
02:20:31,479 --> 02:20:32,639
... France!”

288
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:47,000
English boats
monitoring
the Mediterranean.

289
02:21:07,639 --> 02:21:10,920
CHANCE

290
02:21:25,079 --> 02:21:29,760
“Captain,
allow me to sink
this flagless sailboat...”

291
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:36,479
“No, no,
my little Nelson.”
(Historical)

292
02:21:44,879 --> 02:21:52,600
“Let us not lose
our bullets
for fugitives
of such little importance.”

293
02:23:25,639 --> 02:23:33,719
THE SIEGE OF
TOULON

294
02:23:33,719 --> 02:23:43,000
Taking refuge in the suburbs
of Toulon to flee the
September massacres,
Violine and Fleuri

295
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:52,159
quickly understood that the province
would not escape the fury
of extreme factions.

296
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:59,280
Violine, the little daughter
of Tristan Fleuri.
(Annabella)

297
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:57,879
“The civil war,
as horrible
as it may be,

298
02:26:57,879 --> 02:27:07,680
is nothing yet my friends
compared to the terrible
tragedy
of our open borders.”

299
02:29:25,639 --> 02:29:33,399
“We are going backwards all over!
It is a disaster,
France is lost!”

300
02:30:17,959 --> 02:30:28,799
In September 1793, the port
of Toulon, where 20,000 Englishmen,
Italians, and Spaniards were

301
02:30:28,799 --> 02:30:37,399
entrenched, was besieged by a
French army commanded
by General Carteaux.

302
02:30:37,399 --> 02:30:41,879
Napoléon who came
to be named Second

303
02:30:41,879 --> 02:30:47,280
Captain of the Toulon
Artillery...
(Historical)

304
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:25,280
...was going to find
the armies of the Republic

305
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:30,000
in a state defying all
imagination.
(Stendhal, Hist.)

306
02:34:51,920 --> 02:35:00,760
The painter Carteaux,
general in chief of the armies
besieging Toulon.
(Mr. Courtois)

307
02:36:38,719 --> 02:36:43,440
Salicetti, Corsican deputy at
the Convention, named

308
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:48,000
Army Commissioner
of Toulon.
(Philippe Hériat)

309
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:10,440
“To the health of the great
General Carteaux, future
conqueror of Toulon.”

310
02:38:09,440 --> 02:38:13,040
“What did you come here to do,
young man?”

311
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:19,200
“I come as second in
command to the artillery of the siege,
my general.”
(Historical)

312
02:38:21,239 --> 02:38:23,120
“The artillery?”

313
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:40,760
“But we have no
need! We will take
Toulon with bladed arms!”
(Historical)

314
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:10,719
“In my place, what
would you do, kid?”
(Historical)

315
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:52,799
ENGLISH
REDOUBT

316
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:22,399
“Once the Aiguillete fort is taken,
the English will abandon
the town.”
(Historical)

317
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:34,159
“Well, “Captain Cannon”,
you are not good at
grography.”
(Historical)

318
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:16,479
“Remember this well, young
man, firstly the artillery
is useless and secondly...”

319
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:24,399
“And secondly,
it is unpleasant.”

320
02:42:09,639 --> 02:42:14,680
“This time, I will not hesitate,
I will remind him of the Ecole
de Brienne.”

321
02:42:44,719 --> 02:42:47,040
“My Captain, I was...”

322
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:53,399
“Bread, olives,
and silence!”

323
02:44:11,879 --> 02:44:16,040
Carteaux, recognized as incapable,
was replaced by General
Dugommier.

324
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:31,639
Training men and horses,
Napoléon deploys an incredible
zeal.
(Historical)

325
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:07,879
General Dugommier
did not take long to

326
02:45:07,879 --> 02:45:15,440
realize the exceptional
qualities of his little
artillery captain.

327
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:05,159
Inspection.

328
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:24,200
“Too short!”

329
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:45,559
Toulon thus passed for
one of the vastest and

330
02:47:45,559 --> 02:47:50,200
most formidable entrenched
camps in the world.
(Historical)

331
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:45,399
“Citizen-General, the fire
on “Little Gibraltar” makes

332
02:48:45,399 --> 02:48:52,479
the bastion untenable. We
have given the order to evacuate
the rooms.”

333
02:48:59,639 --> 02:49:05,360
The English redoubt of
“Little Gibraltar.”

334
02:49:32,799 --> 02:49:35,159
“Take this piece to
its place.”

335
02:49:38,239 --> 02:49:41,000
“Impossible, my Captain!”

336
02:49:42,920 --> 02:49:45,920
“Impossible is not
French.”
(Historical)

337
02:50:45,799 --> 02:50:50,680
“Mind your trade
as a deputy and leave me
to do my trade as a gunman.

338
02:50:50,680 --> 02:50:55,600
This battery will stay there,
otherwise I am leaving!”

339
02:50:57,440 --> 02:51:01,000
“Heads have rolled for
less bold replies!”

340
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:38,600
“Tremendous! I no longer
need sand.”

341
02:51:42,239 --> 02:51:45,399
“My friend Junot, I like
you.”

342
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:27,760
Battery of Fearless Men

343
02:53:48,440 --> 02:53:53,200
“Captain Bonaparte, I
name you Commander in
Chief of the artillery!”

344
02:54:22,479 --> 02:54:26,760
“To take Toulon, it is
better to let him do it.”

345
02:54:49,680 --> 02:54:55,200
Free to move,
Bonaparte goes on the offensive.

346
02:55:38,079 --> 02:55:44,200
He establishes two batteries
on the edge of the sea, called the
“Batteries of Montagne

347
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:50,440
and Sans-Culottes”. Which
obligated enemy vessels
to evacuate the Petite Rade.
(Historical)

348
02:57:05,440 --> 02:57:14,440
With insane bravura
he pursues his successes until
the Big Tower, from which he isolates
the garrison.

349
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:10,600
On 16 December 1793,
French Headquarters
held a decisive
council of war.

350
02:58:58,639 --> 02:59:01,639
“I order or I keep quiet.”

351
02:59:41,680 --> 02:59:51,639
The enemy council of
war was quite reminiscent
of the Tower of Babel.

352
03:00:00,159 --> 03:00:05,639
The English Admiral
Hoode...
(Mr. Day)

353
03:00:12,479 --> 03:00:18,000
“We are masters
of the sea.
The French fleet

354
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:24,639
is our hostage,
prisoner in the port.”
(Hist.-Cottin)

355
03:00:45,159 --> 03:00:51,600
“20,000 Englishmen,
Spaniards, Italians,
make our forts

356
03:00:51,600 --> 03:00:56,200
impregnable.
I have
no worries.”
(Hist)

357
03:01:38,079 --> 03:01:43,600
“Toulon has only one weak side
on the harbor, the promontory

358
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:48,479
of Aiguillette. If we
take it, the city is
ours.”

359
03:01:56,319 --> 03:02:00,000
“We will thus
attack tonight at midnight.”

360
03:02:22,799 --> 03:02:28,040
“Are you all indeed of
this opinion?”

361
03:02:49,319 --> 03:02:51,959
- “You do not understand war!”
-“Is this a betrayal?”

362
03:02:51,959 --> 03:02:53,959
- “Is this a betrayal?”
-“Who and what is in charge here?”

363
03:02:53,959 --> 03:02:56,440
- “You do not understand war!”
-“Is this a betrayal?”

364
03:02:56,440 --> 03:02:58,399
- “You do not understand war!”
-“I do not understand.”

365
03:02:58,399 --> 03:02:59,000
- “Translate!”

366
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:17,840
“Order_,
Calm_,
Silence_”

367
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:31,120
Preparations for Combat.

368
03:05:41,559 --> 03:05:45,040
“A little patience! It is
seven in the evening.

369
03:05:45,040 --> 03:05:49,399
We
will surprise the enemy
tomorrow at five in the
morning!”

370
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:02,520
“Smoking is prohibited,
but you can
sit down.”

371
03:06:16,600 --> 03:06:22,399
“At what age did the little
drummer Viala die?”

372
03:06:27,680 --> 03:06:28,440
“At thirteen years”

373
03:06:37,399 --> 03:06:43,000
“What luck! I then still
have six years left to live!”

374
03:07:03,840 --> 03:07:10,920
Napoléon was vested,
by the soldiers' wishes,
with the exercise of

375
03:07:10,920 --> 03:07:16,239
command even though
there were generals
present.

376
03:07:54,680 --> 03:08:00,719
“We will fight, I
authorize you to sing.”

377
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:17,280
Mal- brough goes away to wa·r mi - ron
ton - ton - ton mi - ron - tai - ne 

378
03:10:13,399 --> 03:10:20,600
Despite the express prohibition
by the Commissioners to the
armies dreading the storm,

379
03:10:20,600 --> 03:10:26,680
Bonaparte gives the signal
to attack to the artillery.
(Historical)

380
03:11:08,399 --> 03:11:17,840
Divulging then a
magnificent plan of attack,
he launches the Victor and
Delaborde columns onto

381
03:11:17,840 --> 03:11:26,360
the Sardinian and Spanish wings,
saving for himself
the center attack on
the English.

382
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:21,360
Dugommier's disobedience
of Napoléon's orders and his

383
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:28,239
fortunately minor
injury lead to the
retreat of the French.

384
03:16:00,600 --> 03:16:06,799
The Conventionals
decide, at this moment,
to suspend the assault.

385
03:16:25,559 --> 03:16:29,840
“We have just
guillotined in Paris

386
03:16:29,840 --> 03:16:37,520
the generals Houchard
and Custine for
less serious mistakes.”

387
03:16:46,840 --> 03:16:52,719
“Bonaparte has just
committed the greatest
crime in history.

388
03:16:52,719 --> 03:16:55,879
This attack on
a night like this!

389
03:16:55,879 --> 03:17:03,840
It is such madness
that his head would not suffice
to pay for it! ”
(Historical)

390
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:23,360
Order to captain Bonaparte
to suspend the attack
right now
General in Chief Dugommier

391
03:18:01,760 --> 03:18:11,719
Order to captain Bonaparte
to suspend the attack
right now
General in Chief Dugommier

392
03:18:41,120 --> 03:18:42,280
“Orators!”

393
03:19:17,280 --> 03:19:19,719
“Are you responsible
for success?”

394
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:39,600
“The general in chief
takes the responsibility

395
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:47,280
of operations on his head
and decides to continue
the siege.”

396
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:51,440
Bonaparte never showed
a similar intrepidity 
during his other campaigns.

397
03:20:51,440 --> 03:21:00,799

He is everywhere, sees everything,
is enough for anything. The lightning
from the sky and cannons surround him.

398
03:21:00,799 --> 03:21:05,840
He is in the fire, in his
element.
(Chuquet) (Hist.)

399
03:22:09,040 --> 03:22:13,959
“And tomorrow, my general,
you will sleep
in Toulon.”

400
03:24:32,719 --> 03:24:34,520
“Turn the guns.”

401
03:24:46,479 --> 03:24:54,760
The English canonmen
are being hacked to pices on their
guns. Of all those

402
03:24:54,760 --> 03:25:03,520
who defend the redoubt,
there is not one who has no
injury.
(Historical)

403
03:25:55,799 --> 03:25:59,520
The Attack of Little
Gibraltar.

404
03:26:53,559 --> 03:27:02,399
“This is nothing,
I already saw all this
at Brienne!
Bold Straw Nose!”

405
03:28:47,159 --> 03:28:53,559
The English general
O'Hara orders the
retreat.

406
03:29:50,719 --> 03:29:52,440
“Marcellin!”

407
03:30:57,200 --> 03:31:02,959
And in the middle of obscurity,
the rain, a terrible
wind, the disorder

408
03:31:02,959 --> 03:31:09,879
of cadavers, the screams of
the wounded and the dying,
we no longer shoot, we tackle

409
03:31:09,879 --> 03:31:15,879
each other hand to hand. No
other weapons than iron.
(Napoléon's Memoirs)

410
03:33:12,040 --> 03:33:16,280
“Go get me
this young captain
who has been fighting

411
03:33:16,280 --> 03:33:19,680
like a tiger for
two hours.”
(Historical)

412
03:33:54,000 --> 03:33:56,040
“Your name?”

03:33:57,879 --> 03:34:00,120
“Desaix.”

414
03:34:47,559 --> 03:34:51,399
“Take out
the English squadron...”

415

“...and burn
the French squadron.”

03:35:47,559 --> 03:35:55,719
The French troops,
after 76 hours of
combat in the mud and
the storm, seized,

417
03:35:55,719 --> 03:36:03,040
at 4 in the morning, the
last English redoubt.
(Napoléon's Memoirs)

418
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:19,719
“The drums?
Where are the drums
of the 6th?”

419
03:36:45,479 --> 03:36:48,680
“The drums?
Present!!”

420
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:54,559
Fallen under gunfire, the
drums of the 6th were going

421
03:36:54,559 --> 03:36:58,600
to be replaced in their
task by an unforeseen
auxiliary...

422
03:37:03,760 --> 03:37:06,040
...hail.

423
03:38:22,360 --> 03:38:28,239
“I believe
that this man
will save France.”

424
03:38:48,159 --> 03:38:55,959
After the Victory.

425
03:39:59,319 --> 03:40:05,799
At dawn, from the top
of the Aiguillette, one of
the greatest spectacles

426
03:40:05,799 --> 03:40:12,600
that had struck the imagination
of Napoleon offered itself to
his view.
(Chuquet)

427
03:42:07,319 --> 03:42:13,959
“What... is the name of...
this captain?”

428
03:42:15,280 --> 03:42:18,520
“Napoléon Bonaparte.”

429
03:42:45,079 --> 03:42:52,959
At dawn, the commissioners
of the Armies who came to give
him, as a token of

430
03:42:52,959 --> 03:43:02,840
apology, the rank of brigadier
general, find him asleep,
his head on a drum.
(Historical)

431
03:43:32,639 --> 03:43:37,399
“Here is
the taker of Toulon!”
(Historical)

432
03:44:51,040 --> 03:44:55,840
End of the
First Part.
